Training is teaching, or developing in oneself or others, any skills and knowledge or fitness that relate to specific useful competencies.
<div style="text-align:center;">
Training has specific goals of improving one's capability, capacity, productivity and performance    
</div>
<div style="text-align:center;">
It forms the core of apprenticeships and provides the backbone of content at institutes of technology
<div style="text-align:center;">
 In addition to the basic training required for a trade, occupation or profession
<div style="text-align:center;">
training may continue beyond initial competence to maintain, upgrade and update skills
<div style="text-align:center;">
 People within some professions and occupations may refer to this sort
<div style="text-align:center;">
of training as professional development.Training also refers to
<div style="text-align:center;">
the development of physical fitness related to a specific
<div style="text-align:center;">
competence, such as sport, martial arts
<div style="text-align:center;">
 military applications and some other occupations.

<div style="text-align:center;">
 
Physical training concentrates on mechanistic goals: training programs in
 this area develop specific motor skills, agility, strength or physical fitness,
 often with an intention of peaking at a particular time.

In military use, training means gaining the physical ability to perform and survive
 in combat, and learn the many skills needed in a time of war. These include how to use 
 a variety of weapons, outdoor survival skills, and how to survive being captured by the 
 enemy, among many others. See military education and training.

For psychological or physiological reasons, people who believe it may be beneficial
 to them can choose to practice relaxation training, or autogenic training, in an attempt to increase 
 their ability to relax or deal with stress.[1] While some studies have indicated relaxation training
 is useful for some medical conditions, autogenic training has limited results or has been the result of few studies.
